Both the browser & Node use JavaScript as their programming language

Browser
- most of the time what you are doing is interacting with 
    DOM
    other Web Platform APIs like Cookies
- document, window ===> not available in Node

Node
- you have access to filesystem (can read/write files from OS)
- You can control environment in Node
    what version of node our code runs in
- but you cant control what browsers users use
- both commonjs, ES module compliant
    you can use both import & require
    browsers only implement ES
