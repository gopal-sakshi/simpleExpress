bodyparser
- body-parser extracts the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req.body.
- When you don't use body-parser 
    you get the raw request (your body & headers aren't in the root object of request parameter). 
    You will have to individually manipulate all the fields.
- But http POST/PUT requests will have "body"
    - So, to handle HTTP POST requests in Express.js (version 4 & above), you need to install the middleware module called body-parser.


APPROACH 1

A) app.use(express.json()); 
    // then, you can access req.body
    // because --->  exports.json = bodyParser.json;        // from express documentation

B) see "simpleNode" repo (or) request_body.txt file in nodejs/docs folder
